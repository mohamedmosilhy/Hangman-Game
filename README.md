<h2>Gameplay</h2>

1. **Random Word Selection:** The game starts by selecting a random word from a predefined list of words. This word is the target that the player needs to guess.

2. **Guessing Letters:** Players can choose letters from the alphabet provided on the screen. They click on the letters they believe are part of the hidden word.

3. **Revealing Correct Letters:** If a chosen letter is part of the hidden word, it is revealed in the appropriate position(s) within the word.

4. **Hangman Drawing:** Incorrectly guessed letters trigger the appearance of parts of the hangman's drawing. The hangman's figure is drawn gradually with each incorrect guess. First, the stand appears, then the rope, the head, the body, the hands, and finally, the legs.

5. **Game Over - Win or Lose:** The game continues until the player has guessed the entire word or until the full hangman drawing is completed (after 8 incorrect guesses). If the player guesses the word correctly, a victory message appears, congratulating them on their win. If the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed, a defeat message appears, indicating that the player has lost the game.
